## 🚨 Security Incident Response

### Integrity Violation Detection

If integrity verification fails:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   ```bash
   # Stop all operations
   # Document the violation
   echo "$(date): Integrity violation detected" >> security/incidents.log
   
   # Run comprehensive audit
   python security/checksums.py verify --verbose > security/audit_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
   ```

2. **Investigation Steps**
   - Compare checksums with known good values
   - Check GPG signature validity
   - Review recent file modifications
   - Analyze system access logs

3. **Recovery Procedures**
   - Restore files from verified backups
   - Regenerate checksums and signatures
   - Update security documentation
   - Implement additional monitoring

### Signature Verification Failure

If GPG signature verification fails:

1. **Verification Steps**
   ```bash
   # Check key validity
   gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint
   
   # Verify against multiple sources
   gpg --verify security/signatures/file.sig original/file
   
   # Check key trust chain
   gpg --check-trustdb
   ```

2. **Resolution Actions**
   - Re-import public key from trusted source
   - Verify key fingerprint against official channels
   - Re-sign affected files if necessary
   - Document incident and resolution

## 🔒 Key Management

### GPG Key Lifecycle

1. **Key Generation**
   - RSA-4096 keys with 2-year expiration
   - Strong passphrase protection
   - Secure key storage

2. **Key Distribution**
   - Public keys included in repository
   - Fingerprint verification required
   - Multiple distribution channels

3. **Key Rotation**
   - Annual key review process
   - Advance notification of key changes
   - Gradual transition procedures

### Key Security Best Practices

- **Storage**: Keys stored in secure directories with restricted permissions
- **Backup**: Encrypted key backups in multiple locations
- **Access**: Limited access with audit trails
- **Revocation**: Clear revocation procedures and communication
